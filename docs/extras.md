# 🔧 Optional Add-Ins for VB6 IDE

For those who want to extend the Visual Basic 6 environment with more modern productivity tools, several add-ins can still be used on Windows 10/11:

## 🔹 MZ-Tools 3 for VB6

- Adds advanced search, code templates, reusable snippets, error-handling generators, and other professional features.
- Fully compatible with this VB6 setup.
- Commercial license required (around $79.95).
- 🔗 [Official website](https://www.mztools.com/)

## 🔹 Smart Indenter (Free)

- Classic code formatting add-in for consistent indentation in VB6 projects.
- Works perfectly on modern Windows systems.

## 🔹 CodeSmart 2009 (Legacy)

- An older but powerful refactoring and navigation suite for VB6 (no longer maintained).
- Works partially on Windows 10/11, but may require compatibility mode.

> These add-ins are not included in the default installer to keep the package lightweight and license-compliant, but all of them can be installed manually if desired.
