# Optional Add-Ins for VB6 IDE

This document lists optional and legally distributable extensions that enhance the VB6 IDE experience on modern Windows systems (10/11).

These tools are **not included** in the main installer to keep it lightweight and license-compliant.  
You can install them manually — they integrate automatically with the VB6 IDE.

## 🗣️ Double Agent (MS Agent Replacement)

**Double Agent** provides a compatible implementation for modern Windows.

## 💡 Additional Notes

- The original **Smart Indenter 3.5** add-in is no longer publicly available.  
  However, VB6 still includes basic formatting options through the **Add-In Manager**  
  and indentation settings under `Tools → Options → Editor Format`.  

- All tools listed above were verified to work correctly with this VB6 package.  
- You can add or remove them anytime without affecting VB6 itself.  

> ⚙️ **Future Add-Ins:**  
> Any free or open-source extensions that are compatible with modern Windows  
> and do not violate licensing terms will likely be added to future installer releases.  
> For now, no freely distributable add-ins were found suitable for direct inclusion.

> 🧠 *Tip:* If you discover an open-source VB6 utility that runs reliably on Windows 11, feel free to suggest it for inclusion here or open a pull request.
