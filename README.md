> Enables editing and running legacy VB6 applications directly on modern Windows.

## üíæ About

This package provides a ready-to-use setup for running and compiling VB6 projects on Windows 10 and 11, without needing virtual machines or manual OCX registration. It's ideal for maintaining old software, analyzing legacy code, or building quick utilities in a familiar environment.

üëâ For background information, setup explanations, and optional components, see the [blog post](https://milos-p-lab.github.io/VB6-on-Windows-11/blog).

## üöÄ Features

- Fully working VB6 IDE on Windows 10 and 11 (including 24H2)
- No need to manually register ActiveX controls or system DLLs
- Registry and batch files automate all configuration steps
- Supports compiling, editing, and running old projects out-of-the-box
- Ideal for educational purposes, small utilities, and legacy support

---

## üìÇ How It Works

The entire environment is packaged as a self-extracting archive containing:

- The original `VB6.exe` executable and IDE files
- All necessary runtime libraries and dependencies
- Preconfigured registry settings to ensure compatibility with modern Windows
- Batch scripts to automate the registration of ActiveX controls and system libraries
- Required OCX/DLL files (e.g. `mscomctl.ocx`, `msstkprp.dll`)
- Registration scripts (`.reg`, `.bat`) that ensure VB6 components work properly
- A desktop and Start menu shortcut for easy access to the VB6 IDE

All actions are performed locally on your machine ‚Äî no system-level installations or persistent changes beyond what's required for VB6 to function.

---

## üîê Antivirus Warning

Some antivirus programs ‚Äî including Windows Defender ‚Äî may flag the self-extracting installation archive as suspicious or even as malware. This is a **false positive**, triggered by the nature of the WinRAR SFX archive, which includes scripts (.bat, .reg) that modify system settings to enable VB6 functionality.

> You can safely run the installer if you downloaded it from this repository. If in doubt, inspect or extract the contents manually before execution.

We recommend temporarily disabling real-time protection only during installation, if necessary, and restoring it immediately afterward.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The solution has been successfully tested on Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows 11 (24H2), but due to variations in system configurations and updates, full compatibility is not guaranteed.
- Microsoft officially ended support for VB6 development tools; this package is provided for educational, archival, and legacy support purposes.
- This setup is **not recommended** for creating new business applications ‚Äî for long-term development, consider porting to modern technologies such as .NET.

### Note on ActiveX Component Versions (e.g., MSCOMCTL.OCX)

This setup includes the official versions of key ActiveX components shipped with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6).
For example, MSCOMCTL.OCX is provided in version 6.1.98.34, which is the original SP6 release.

You may currently have newer versions of these files installed (e.g., 6.1.98.46, 6.1.98.50), which might have been registered by:

- Microsoft Office (2007‚Äì2016)
- Windows Update security patches
- Other software bundling ActiveX controls

## üíæ Automatic Backup Before Overwriting

If an existing OCX/DLL file is found during setup, it will be backed up before being replaced ‚Äî for example:

``` plaintext
MSCOMCTL.OCX.old
COMDLG32.OCX.old
TABCTL32.OCX.old
```

This allows you to easily restore your previous version ‚Äî which may be newer ‚Äî if you wish to keep it.

üëâ Recommendation

If you want to restore a backed-up file, simply re-register it using:

``` batch
regsvr32 /s "C:\VB6Backup\MSCOMCTL.OCX.old"
```

Or, for a different file:

``` batch
regsvr32 /s "C:\VB6Backup\SomeOtherControl.dll.old"

```

(Adjust paths as needed ‚Äî the .old files will be in the same folder as the replaced files unless moved manually.)

This project aims for maximum stability and compatibility with legacy VB6 projects, so original SP6 versions are shipped by default ‚Äî but your backups give you full control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download the `Visual-Basic-6-for-Win10-11.exe` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/milos-p-lab/VB6-on-Windows-11/releases/) page.
2. Run the installer (self-extracting archive) with administrative privileges.
3. Follow the prompts; all required files will be extracted and configured automatically.
4. After installation, launch VB6 from the desktop shortcut, which is created automatically by the installer for your convenience.

‚úÖ Tested successfully on:

- **Windows 11 (23H2, 24H2)**
- **Windows 10 (22H2)**
- **Windows 7 SP1**
- **Windows Server 2003 R2**
- **Windows XP SP3**

## üí° Why not just recompile in C#, Java, etc.?

You could ‚Äî but certain legacy behaviors (e.g., precise startup timing, COM interop, message handling, or agent-like UI features) can‚Äôt be easily replicated in .NET or Java.

For example, utilities like `delaycmd.exe` allow precise control over when and how a dependent application is launched. This can be critical when dealing with shell extensions, startup scripts, or software requiring legacy timing patterns that modern `Process.Start()` (C#) or `Runtime.exec()` (Java) don't handle well.

## üß≥ Use Cases

- Recovering and analyzing old VB6 code
- Maintaining legacy desktop utilities still in production use
- Developing small tools or prototypes using familiar VB6 workflow
- Educational exploration of legacy programming paradigms
- Avoiding the need for full virtual machine environments

This repository provides a preconfigured environment based on existing redistributable components. The author does not distribute proprietary software ‚Äî the package assumes you have the legal right to use VB6 and related tools.
