## ⚠️ Limitations

- The solution has been successfully tested on Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows 11 24H2, but due to variations in system configurations and updates, full compatibility is not guaranteed. Use at your own discretion, especially in production environments.
- Use at your own risk. Microsoft does not officially support VB6 on modern systems. This setup is intended for software preservation, educational purposes, and maintaining legacy tools.
